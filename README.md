Introduction to Dynamic Recompilation in Emulation

An accompanying document that attempts to explain the concepts used in creating the dynamic recompiler emulator within my Super8_jitcore repo (edu branch).
I will try to update this document if more questions are asked or if further explanations are needed.

For the most part, you should be able to follow the code as there is lots of comments in place. The document tries to desribe the high-level ideas more over than the low level ideas and implementations.

Download the "Introduction to Dynamic Recompilation in Emulation.docx [or pdf]" to begin reading, and take notice of the LICENCE included.
